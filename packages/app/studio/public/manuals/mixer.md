## 0. Overview

The mixer displays channel strips for all audio-units including instruments, audio buses, and the main output. Each strip provides controls for volume, pan, routing, and monitoring.

Access the mixer by:
- Pressing **M** to toggle the mixer panel
- Pressing **Shift+2** to switch to the full mixer screen
- Using the **Tab** key to cycle through screens

## 1. Channel Strip

Each channel strip contains the following controls from top to bottom:

### 1.1 Icon

Displays the audio-unit type:
- {icon:Robot} Instrument
- {icon:AudioBus} Audio Bus
- {icon:Headphone} Main Output

### 1.2 Input Label

Shows the name of the audio-unit. Click to select the channel.

### 1.3 Sends

Route audio to effect buses or auxiliary channels.
- Click {icon:Add} to add a new send
- Each send has its own level control

### 1.4 Output

Select the destination for this channel's audio:
- **Output**: Routes directly to the main output
- **Bus name**: Routes to an audio bus for group processing
- {icon:Headphone} Click to monitor this channel directly through headphones

### 1.5 Pan

Stereo position control. Center position outputs equally to left and right channels.

### 1.6 Volume

Current peak level display in dB. Values turning **red** indicate clipping (signal exceeding 0dB).

### 1.7 Fader

Adjusts the channel volume in dB. The scale ranges from -54dB to +6dB.

### 1.8 Level Meter

Stereo peak meter showing real-time audio levels:
- **Green**: Safe levels
- **Yellow**: Approaching 0dB
- **Red**: Clipping (above 0dB)

### 1.9 Mute / Solo

- {icon:Mute}: Silences this channel
- {icon:Solo}: Solos this channel, muting all non-soloed channels

### 1.10 Exclude

Toggle to exclude this channel from the mixer view.

## 2. Signal Flow

Audio flows through the mixer in this order:

1. **Instrument/Source** generates audio
2. **Fader** adjusts level
3. **Pan** positions in the stereo field
4. **Sends** tap signal to buses (post-fader)
5. **Output** routes to destination bus or main output
6. **Main Output** sums all routed audio to speakers/headphones

---

## 3. Buses

Audio buses group multiple channels for collective processing:

- Create a bus by adding an **Audio Bus** device
- Route channels to the bus using their **Output** selector
- Apply effects to the bus to process all routed channels together
- Common uses: drum bus compression, reverb sends, parallel processing

## 4. Tips

- Hold ⌥ while adjusting faders for fine control
- Double-click a fader to reset to 0dB
- Watch for red clipping indicators and reduce levels accordingly
- Use buses to organize and process related instruments together
- The main output meter shows your final mix level

# Audio Bus

An Audio Bus is a virtual channel that groups multiple audio sources for collective processing and routing.

## Concept

In traditional mixing, a bus (or buss) is a signal path that combines multiple audio channels into one. Think of it as a
funnel: many sources flow into a single channel where they can be processed together before reaching the main output.

Common use cases:

- **Drum Bus**: Route all drum tracks to one bus, apply compression to glue them together
- **Reverb Send**: Create a bus with a reverb effect, send portions of multiple tracks to it
- **Parallel Processing**: Blend a heavily compressed copy with the dry signal
- **Submix Groups**: Group backing vocals, strings, or other instrument sections

## Creating a Bus

Buses are created through the [Mixer](mixer) when setting up routing:

### FX Bus (for sends)

1. Open the Mixer
2. On any channel, find the **Sends** section
3. Click {icon:Add} to open the send menu
4. Select **New FX Bus...**
5. Enter a name and choose an icon

The new FX bus appears in the mixer, and a send is automatically created to route audio to it.

### Output Bus (for grouping)

1. Open the Mixer
2. On any channel, click the **Output** selector
3. Select **New Output Bus...**
4. Enter a name and choose an icon

The channel's output is automatically routed to the new bus.

## Sends vs Direct Routing

There are two ways to route audio to a bus:

- **Direct Routing**: The channel's entire output goes to the bus. Use the Output selector to choose the bus. Best for submix groups, drum buses, and parallel compression.

- **Send**: The signal is tapped and added to the bus for mixdown. The original signal continues to its destination while the bus processes a tapped portion. Both contribute to the final mix. Best for shared reverb and delay effects.

## Adding Effects

Add effects to process all routed audio together:

1. Select the bus in the timeline
2. Add audio effects as you would to any audio-unit
3. Effects apply to the combined signal of all sources routed to this bus
